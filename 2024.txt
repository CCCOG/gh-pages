No one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:11

Christ, our cornerstone, we can so easily become focused on the bricks and mortar of the church that we forget that the church is your body of believers, and you are the foundation.

Even more, we thank you for your gift of Jesus Christ whose life and teaching call us to his new law of love for you and our neighbor.

Open our heart, holy one, in faith, hope, and love, that we may help carry out the precious work needed to sustain the needs of the world in wisdom and grace. We trust you to give us exactly what we need to live your wisdom all day, every day. You are Immanuel, God with us. Amen.

If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it. 1 Corinthians 12:26

Holy Trinity—Abba, Jesus, and Spirit—you dwell in community. You invite us to imagine that we can do the same—sharing joy, sharing burdens, knowing one another as sister or brother. Your love gives us the strength to live together for the sake of the whole, rather than only for self-centered gain. Teach us to love with heart, soul, and mind. Amen.

Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. Romans 15:7

Christ of welcoming and open arms, in fear, we often cross our arms tightly across our vulnerable hearts, keeping out those we name “Other.” May our desire be to imitate your cruciform invitation, arms open wide, risking all for the sake of welcoming all. Fulfill this desire in us, please! Amen.

See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. 1 Thessalonians 5:15

Healer of all ills, it is hard for us to love fully and freely each day. Heal within us that which is afraid, jealous, or lonely. May we be open to receive your love each and every day, and then live that love in such a way that healing can come to earth and all her creatures. May your love flow through us into the world, for the sake of the world. Amen.

While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off. Acts 13:2-3

We so easily forget, Lord Jesus, to be still and quiet. We forget daily practices of prayer and fasting, singing and moving. Thus, we are often unable to hear you when you speak to our hearts. Our desire, beloved, is to listen, to share, to make room for you. Today, we set aside time to be only with you. Fill our hearts with the power of silence. Amen.

In that love, we praise you and give you thanks. Amen.

We smile, divine Tailor, at the wonder of your handiwork. You have been clothing your children since you walked the coolness of the night in the Garden of Eden.

This is right and acceptable before God our Savior, who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 1 Timothy 2:3-4

God who is the giver of blessings, you offer wholeness for a broken world; you offer well-being to each and every person; you offer the holy work of sharing your good news through all we say and do. May we receive what you offer in gratitude and awe. May we then share what you so freely give, so others will know the truth of your salvation, your healing. Amen.

Taking her by the hand, Jesus said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, get up!” And immediately the girl stood up and began to walk about. Mark 5:41-42

We confess, O God of light and life, trust is hard for us. We easily turn to the foolishness of trusting ourselves, our gifts, our plans, and forget that all of it, all of it, is from you. In this moment, we return to you our hearts and will and being. Free us from seeing only ourselves; free us to live life through and in you. Amen.

Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.” John 1:45

Creator of the universe, holy womb of life, “seek” and “find” seem strange words to describe our desire for you. You are always here; wherever we are, there you are. Open our hearts to see this truth when we feel lost, abandoned, or forlorn. To find you, we have only to open the eyes of our hearts. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

The counsel of the Lord stands forever. Psalm 33:11

In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will. Ephesians 1:11

Sometimes, Counselor of wisdom and grace, we sing or speak words as if they are truth, as if they are already the reality of our lives. In fact, they are often more truly our hopes, our desires. We repeat these words as our prayer: “Be the treasure of great worth in our lives, first in our hearts.” This is our longing. We open our hearts to you. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.


Saturday, August 31, 2024 — Psalm 105:1–7

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Matthew 5:9

We end this month, loving God, with the reminder that we are your children, children of the one and only God!

Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ Matthew 6:31

The devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan!” Matthew 4:8-10
